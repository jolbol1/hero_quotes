# Hero Widsom
> A JavaScript terminal program that will show the user a random quote from a random hero.
> I have selected the quotes and hero's.

## Usage
Run this project with node

`node script.js`

## Project
This is my first portfolio project for the Codecademy Full Stack Engnieer Carrer Path course.

## Prompt
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Improvements
This project was rather simple. To improve this I would find an API which could pull a far larger list of quotes from a database. This could include options for the movie name and timestamps. Further I would add a web interface with some personalisation options.
